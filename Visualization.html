							of age 30 and its almost similar to the crashes that occured by the 25 year age group in that particular year.
							Less number of accidents occured by the age group of 23 and 29 compared to the age group of 27 and 40.
							Overall, the least number of accidents are made by the age group of 50 since they engage in safe driving ,
							Wearing the seat belts. The average number of crashes are more likely to be happened by the age group of 27-35.

							From the pie chart we can find that many more Men than Women are casualties of car accidents.
							Over the course of a year men represented 60 percent of casualties while women accounted for 40 percent.
							Studies have shown that men are more likely to be associated with anger, risky and dissociative styles
							where as women are more associated with patient driving styles. 16-19 year olds are the highest risk to be
							involved in the accident. Teens are more likely involved in crashes due to rash driving and lowest rates of
							seat belt use compared to other age groups.
