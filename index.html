					<h2>Few facts about Traffic Collisions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashe.
							Half of those injured or killed in crashes are vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.
						</li>
						<li>
							Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole.
							These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries,
							and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured.
							Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.
						</li>
						<li>
							An increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase in mean speed produces
							a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk.
						</li>
						<li>
							In the case of drug-driving, the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. For example, the risk of a fatal crash occurring among
							those who have used amphetamines is about 5 times the risk of someone who hasn't.
						</li>
						<li>
							Using a mobile phone while driving increases your chance of crashing by 400%. Cell phone use is an increasingly significant problem on the roads and as the U.S. National Safety Council compiled more than 30 studies postulating that hands-free is not a safer option, because the
							brain remains distracted by the conversation and cannot focus solely on the task of driving.
						</li>
